# Heart Disease Prediction

## Data Science Project on Heart Disease

### Overview
This project is an end-to-end Data Science pipeline focused on predicting heart disease based on patient attributes. Using machine learning techniques, I will analyze and extract valuable insights from the dataset to aid in understanding and diagnosing heart disease.

### Context
This is a multivariate dataset containing 14 key attributes related to heart disease prediction. The dataset originates from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and has been widely used in medical machine learning research. The main objective is to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on their medical attributes and to uncover insights that may contribute to better understanding the condition.
